 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Forrest's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
I began my journey towards web development by watching a video from a YouTuber named Dalto. At that moment, I became very interested in the workflow of a web developer. I am someone who rarely gets bored in front of a computer, regardless of the task. At that time, I was doing an internship in a different field that didn't completely convince me. Web development interests me because everything we know about the internet can be accessed from a mobile device, and seeing the potential that can be achieved with an interconnected system makes it even more appealing to me. It can involve creating apps for productivity, entertainment, or services. Currently, I am enrolled and in the selection process for the 'ONE - Oracle Next Education' program. I have high expectations for the future that this radical decision will lead me to.
